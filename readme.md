using their bank data including income, loan annuity, credit amount and personal data including
amount of children, income etc. <br>

In order to evaluate the clients various machine learning models were used, including:
<li> LogisticRegression</li>
<li>GaussianNB</li>
<li>RandomForestClassifier</li>
<li>XGBClassifier</li>
<li>KNeighboursClassifier</li>
<li>DecisionTreeClassifie</li>
<br>
One of the focus points of this was handling unbalanced data regarding data availability for different target class values.
